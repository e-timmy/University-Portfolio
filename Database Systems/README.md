# Database Systems (INFO20003) | The University of Melbourne | Autumn 2022

### Description
In this subject I learnt the fundamentals behind database management systems. In particular, we became familiar with database system architectures and exercised concepts like query processing, optimisation, database tuning, and transactions. Within weekly exercises and assignments I became familiar with Entity Relationship modelling (from conceptual design to physical modelling), normalisation, de-normalisation, transactions, storage, organisation, database administration, data warehousing, and big data analytics. \
