# Data Structures I (COMP90015) | Charles University | Autumn 2023

### Description
We learnt efficient data structures for trees, heaps, and hashing in this subject. Focus on mathematical proof of their properties,
utilising worst-case, average-case, and amortized complexity analysis. \
Theory: amortized complexity (accounting, coin, potential); self-adjusting ds; cache models; ds for systems with memory hierarchy; 
hashing families; open-addressing; linear probing; construction of LCP array via Kasai's algorithm; suffix construction by doubling; 
lock-free data structures. \
Data structures: self-adjusting array; lazily-balanced trees; splay-trees; weighted splay-trees; (a,b)-trees; CO/CA mergesort;
CO/CA matrix transposition; tabulation hashing; cuckoo hashing; bloom filters; (k,d)-trees; mutli-dimensional range trees; suffix arrays;
LCP array; lock-free stack.

### Practical assignments:
- Tress-successor function.
- Splay-tree.
- (a,b)-tree.
- Cache-oblivous matrix-transposition.
- Cuckoo hashing.
- Bloom filters for duplicates.

### Experiment Reports
- Splay-tree: comparing naive implementation and standard implementations of splays on sequential insert, random, and subsets.
- (a,b)-tree: comparing 2-3 and 2-4 trees on insert, minimum deletion then insert, and random.
- CO matrix transposition: comparing naive and cache-oblivious implementations on different number of items and block sizes.
- Cuckoo hashing: comparing different systems of hashing via linear probing by growth, then usage.

### Marks: 
- Practicas & reports were hurdles to take the final oral exam.
- Final mark: A (4.0/4.0)
