# Introduction to Machine Learning (COMP90049) | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022

### Description
In this subject, we learnt the foundational elements of machine learning, including mathematical principles of learning from data, cleaning/normalising data, applied algorithms and data structures for supervised and unsupervised learning, analysis of outcomes, fairness, and bias.
### Machine learning models:
- Supervised: KNN-classifier; Naive Bayes; Linear-regression; Perceptron; Multi-layer Neural Network; Decision-trees; 
- Ensemble: Bagging (Random-forest); Boosting (Adaboost); Stacking
- Semi/unsupervised: Clustering
### Assignments:
- A1, K-nearest Neighbour: implemented and applied the KNN classification algorithm to real-world machine learning data on car prices. Utilised model to predict car affordability given diverse features (make, engine type, style, horsepower, etc.). The process included data preprocessing, implementation of distance metrics, KNN algorithm formation, visualisation and discussion of results. Result: 19/20
- A2, Naive Bayes: implemented Naive Bayes classifier, applied to multiple classification datasets (bank-marketing, obesity, student), analysed the model under evaluation paradigms (One-R, Cross-validation), impact of individual features (Mutual information, data visualisation), and ethical ramifications of deploying the student model. Result: 19.25/20.
