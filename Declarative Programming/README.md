# Declarative Programming (COMP90048) | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022

### Description
In this subject, we learnt about the fundamentals of declarative programming languages and techniques and explored how they differ from procedural languages. /
Across the course, the representational power of declarative languages was focused on, especially in maintaining strong type systems and avoiding the dangers of destructive updates.
The course was divided into two sections. First, logic programming (Prolog), where we focused on unification, resolution, non-determinism, search, and backtracking. Second is functional programming (Haskell), where we focused on strong type systems, parametric polymorphism, algebraic types, type classes, defensive programming practice, higher-order programming, currying/partial application, lazy evaluation, and monads.
If I could pick one takeaway from this course, it would be the sheer beauty of recursion. It's not just a concept, but a fascinating tool that I've come to appreciate and enjoy using. \

### Assignments
- A1, Prolog Maths Problem Solver: I successfully tackled a unique math puzzle (see file for details). By applying Constraint Logic Programming over Finite domains and breaking down the problem into four constraints, I was able to apply a given rule to solve it. I received an H1 and only lost marks on code structure. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.
- A2, Haskell Guess-Feedback Solver: musician puzzle game. There are two players, a Composer and a Performer; the game begins with the Composer selecting a target, a three-pitch musical chord. The performer must guess the chord. Until the guess matches the target, the composer provides feedback in triple (correct pitches, correct notes, correct octaves). The solver begins with an initial guess that was optimised by testing all combinations of chords to find the lowest average guess. Then, it proceeds to minimise the solution space. An all-chord guess space is generated, and based on feedback, impossible guesses are removed. Each remaining chord is fed through the speculative feedback function, and the guess with the lowest average size of the feedback group is selected. Received full marks.
- Exam: accounted for 70% of the subject. Had a bad day and pulled my mark well down.
### Result: 73%
