# Declarative Programming (COMP90048) | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022

### Description
In this subject, we learnt about the fundamentals of declarative programming languages and techniques and explored how they differ from procedural languages. /
Across the course, the representational power of declarative languages was focused on, especially in maintaining strong type systems and avoiding the dangers of destructive updates.
The course was divided up into two sections. First, logic programming (Prolog) where we focused on unification, resolution, nondeterminism, search, and backtracking. Second, functional programming (Haskell), where we focused on strong type systems, parametric polymorphism, algebraic types, type classes, defensive programming practice, higher-order programming, currying/partial application, lazy evaluation, and monads.
If I could pick one takeaway from this course, it would be that recursion is beautiful.
### Assignments
- A1, Prolog Maths Problem Solver: solved unique maths puzzle (see file for details). I achieved this by applying Constraint Logic Programming over Finite domains, by breaking down the problem into four constraints, the solver applied a given rule to solve. Only lost marks on code structure.
- A2,
