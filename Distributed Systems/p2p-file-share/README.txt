\f0\fs24 \cf0 **Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Platform**\
\
- In this project, we implemented a p2p architecture for a file-sharing service using skeleton code provided by the subject coordinator. \
- Compared to a centralised architecture, where users would query a central server to download from, the distributed architecture implemented downloaded blocks of each file from different users sharing on the platform. \
- The process was implemented synchronously, meaning multiple files could be downloaded and shared from different users simultaneously. \
- All of this is incorporated within a GUI, used to query a server on who possessed which file, to upload a certificate saying you could share a file, and to remove this certificate. All\
- We received an H1 for our implementation, only losing one mark for not updating server certificates where possible.}
