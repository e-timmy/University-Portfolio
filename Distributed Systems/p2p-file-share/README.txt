**Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Platform**

- In this project, we implemented a p2p architecture for a file-sharing service using skeleton code provided by the subject coordinator. 
- Compared to a centralised architecture, where users would query a central server to download from, the distributed architecture implemented downloaded blocks of each file from different users sharing on the platform. 
- The process was implemented synchronously, meaning multiple files could be downloaded and shared from different users simultaneously. 
- All of this is incorporated within a GUI, used to query a server on who possessed which file, to upload a certificate saying you could share a file, and to remove this certificate.
- We received an H1 for our implementation, only losing one mark for not updating server certificates where possible.
