### Distributed Systems | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022
Description: learnt system architectures, synchronous programming theories, applied concepts to Java projects, analysed existing real-world distributed systems. \
Projects: peer-to-peer file sharing application (developed from skeleton code); shared-whiteboard application (developed from scratch). \
Final grade: 90% 

### Introduction to Machine Learning | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022
Description: I learned the intellectual foundations of machine learning, including the mathematical principles of learning from data, algorithms and data structures for machine learning, and practical data analysis skills. \
Projects: KNN-classifier; Naive-Bayes classifier with evaluation; toxicity classification research and report \
Final grade: 87% 

### Declarative Programming | The University of Melbourne | Spring 2022
Description: I learned declarative programming fundamentals and techniques and explored how they differed from procedural languages. The course was split into two parts, the first focusing on Logic programming with Prolog and the second half on Functional programming with Haskell.
Projects: Prolog CLP(FD) solver for a unique maths puzzle; unique Haskell solver for guessing-feedback game.
Final grade: 73% 

### Database Systems | The University of Melbourne | Autumn 2022
Description: fundamentals behind database management systems. In particular, we became familiar with database system architectures and exercised concepts like query processing, optimisation, database tuning, and transactions. The course was split into two parts, the first half focused on database representations through Entity Relationship Modelling, moving from conceptual design to physical modelling. The latter half focused on SQL programming and larger concepts. 
Projects: Entity Relationship modelling of Google Scholar's architecture; SQL statements for a fictitious database.
Final grade: 85%
